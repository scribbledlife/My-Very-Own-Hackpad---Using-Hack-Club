My-Very-Own-Hackpad---Using-Hack-Club
This is my first ever build from scratch. This is a macropad with 4 keys, made by using the tutorial provided by Hack Club. 
My name is Mridul Goel, and I am a sophmore. I aspire to be a future aerospace engineer, and as such I though that it would be a good idea to get into this kind of stuff. What you are looking at is a 4 Key macropad, that I made for my first ever project, just to get the hang of things, and different kinds of softwares that are avaliable. I mainly used KiCad for the schematic, and the main PCB wiring. Then I moved onto Fusion 360, working on the bottom and the top case to house te microcontroller and everything as such. 

What everything is: 
1. Schematic & PCB - This was the first step in make my macropad. You can find the provided screenshots of the Schematic, and PCB wiring, so that you are able to get a better view of what everything is. They are in the folder name "Screenshots".

4. Case_Files - These are the 3D printable files that are going to house the PCB, and all the switches and everything that makes the files work.
5. Keyboard_Keycaps - These are all the pre-"Case_Files" files which are the dimensions of the actual Cherry MX Keycaps, so that the case actually fits ontop the keys.
6. main.py - This is the code file for the keyboard, which allows for the keyboard to be properly coded, and work with my laptop. I lowk just copied it from the Blueprint guide, but right now I am trying to learn Python fully, so that I understand what is goin on, and properly.

That is everything in this repository, with every file, everything I worked on, and the whole process. I didn't make a journal becuase it said I don't have to.
