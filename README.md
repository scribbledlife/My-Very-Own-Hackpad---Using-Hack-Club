# My Very Own Hackpad (6-Key Macropad)

**Built for Hack Club** 🚀

This is my first ever build from scratch. This is a macropad with 6 keys, made by using the tutorial provided by Hack Club.

My name is **Mridul Goel**, and I am a sophomore. I aspire to be a future aerospace engineer, and as such I thought that it would be a good idea to get into this kind of stuff. What you are looking at is a 6-key macropad that I made for my first ever project, just to get the hang of things and different kinds of softwares that are available.

I mainly used **KiCad** for the schematic and the main PCB wiring. Then I moved onto **Fusion 360**, working on the bottom and top case to house the microcontroller and everything.

**NOTE**: I modified the original design by changing it from 4 keys to 6 keys, because I found out that this is supposed to be modified to be counted as your own—and well, who doesn't like some more keys right! 😎

## What Everything Is

### 1. Schematic & PCB
This was the first step in making my macropad. You can find the provided screenshots of the Schematic and PCB wiring in the folder named "Screenshots". But below are the images just in case!

### 2. Case_Files
These are the 3D printable files that are going to house the PCB, and all the switches and everything that makes the macropad work.

### 3. Keyboard_Keycaps
These are all the pre-"Case_Files" files which are the dimensions of the actual Cherry MX Keycaps, so that the case actually fits on top of the keys.

### 4. Case Screenshots (Fusion 360)

### 5. main.py
This is the code file for the keyboard, which allows the keyboard to be properly coded and work with my laptop. I lowkey just copied it from the Blueprint guide, but right now I am trying to learn Python fully so that I understand what is going on and can customize it properly.

That is everything in this repository—with every file, everything I worked on, and the whole process. I didn't make a journal because it said I don't have to.

Thanks for checking out my project! 🔧🛠️
